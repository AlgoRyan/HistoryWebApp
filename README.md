Details of the task:

<task>
Part C (30% of final mark) - The New Web Application
The final part of the assignment consists of a short reflective report and a demonstration of the web application. The submitted web application will be complementary to these marks, i.e. demonstrations can sometimes fail and looking at the code can inform us as to what was meant to achieve. The submitted code also helps us to check the validity of claims made during the presentation.
Report
This 5 page report is shorter than the previous parts of the assignment as more emphasis will be on the demonstration.
Your final report should contain your team's reflection on the design and implementation process of your Web application. Think about your submissions for parts A and B of the project. How did the design and modelling in these project parts help your implementation? In particular, what aspects of your final Web app differ from the planned design? Were there any shortcomings in your original plans? If you were to take on a similar-size project again, how would your approach to the design and modelling of the application differ?
Most of you will be completing university subjects with larger groups and real clients next semester. In many ways this assignment is a different version of what you will be doing later. So to reiterate, if you were to take on a similar-size project again, how would your approach differ?

Questions to answer in the team reflection: (Everyone in the team just add dot points to team answer

Q1. How did the design and modelling in these project parts help your implementation?
The Design was super important for the following reasons:
Having a shared vision among all group members 
Allows group members to work on project separately 
Gives target to work towards
Our stakeholders gave us the link to a web application that has a similar purpose which really helped us in terms of presentation design. Since this web application was already well designed we had a target to work towards and could all have the same physical link to look at when we are unsure
A Good design means there are less errors when implementing as you have thought about the potential risks and you have good reasons for doing things a certain way

In particular the presentation design was clear, we were actually given a target by our stakeholders, a different web site with a similar purpose, which was really easy for us to just look at individually and to have something to work towards. We could thus say, this is what we want, but instead we will use this colour, and we will remove these sections as they are irrelevant… etc. 

Q2. In particular, what aspects of your final Web app differ from the planned design?
Team Initially we were planning to have a very basic navigation design, having a control point from the home screen. Moreover, in the journey page, we were planning to implement a better design parallax scrollable museum to make it attractive for viewers. However in the final Web App only implement a simple parallax scrolling effect because of lacks of material to be display.

The main content of the journey page is static and is written directly in the HTML. The initial plan was to fetch all the content form the MySql database.

3. Were there any shortcomings in your original plans?
We did not succeed to make a parallax scrollable museum, more because of lack of material rather than coding issues. A good parallax website is based on high graphics and the quality of the picture we had did not allow us to make it look pretty, informative and understandable at the same time. The lack of a host server did not allow us to fully implement some functionalities even though the code was ready (add-content / login / register / a contact form displayed in modal boxes through a jQuery plugin to make it more convenient and prettier, a CAPTCHA code for security matters). We did stop developing the media gallery as it will be replaced in the foreseeable future by an iFish webpage, but it is not quite ready yet as well. The journey is not dynamic enough, with more time we should have been able to make every item clickable to display in a bigger modal box the picture in original size with descriptions and users’ comments.

Unfortunately, the History Team is only meeting once a week, on Tuesday morning, when most of our members had classes and could not attend the meeting every week. The result is that we did not have the occasion to get regular feedback from our main client and stakeholder which might have been very valuable.

4. If you were to take on a similar-size project again, how would your approach to the design and modelling of the application differ?

A better approach when doing another project would maybe be deciding on a framework in the beginning of the project. A good framework would lead to an easier implementation. A framework also makes it easier to separate tasks since usually the separation of concern is good and clear. An example of a framework that could be used in our web application would be Rails that runs on Ruby which is an MVC pattern framework.

When designing another application, we could be more strict on what we want the design to be at the end. After we have the design that we want, we could start iterating and improve it.
