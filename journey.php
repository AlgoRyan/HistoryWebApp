				<h2>Summary of the beginnings</h2>
				<p>On June 16, 2006, the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, and the Department of Information Systems at the University of Melbourne celebrated Fifty Years of Computing at The University of Melbourne. The event commemorated was the June 14 1956 re-commissioning of the CSIRAC computer, the first at the University, and, until a few months later, when the Sydney University SILLIAC computer became operational, the only one in the country./p>

				<h2>&#126 Computational Department</h2>
                <p> During the period 1956–1971, academic computing operations in the University were conducted by
the Computation Laboratory, subsequently renamed the Computation Department.
2During the 1960s, new computing subjects were developed and provided as part of the BSc degree.
Undergraduate exposure to computing expanded as courses migrated from later year specialist subjects
to second, and ultimately, by 1970, to ﬁrst year.</p>

                In 1969 the University took the decision to split the Department into two components – a computing
                services component, and a teaching unit to be known as the Department of Information Science,
                located in the Faculty of Science. At this time, Dr. Frank Hirst (by now a Reader) was invited to take
                up the foundation chair in computing at the University of Adelaide, creating vacancies at the top of
                both units. Bill Flower was appointed as Acting Head of Information Science, the other academic
                staff being Rex Harris, and Peter Thorne (who, after his undergraduate Physics degree, had worked
                with Hirst to complete another of the ﬁrst computing PhDs in Australia, in 1967). Ian Robinson was
                appointed as a further staff member in 1971. He had completed his undergraduate study at Melbourne,
                including several subjects in computation during 1965–1967, and completed a PhD in 1973 under Dr
                B.W. Thompson, in the Department of Mathematics. Robinson moved to La Trobe University in
                August 1975, where he is now Head of the School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences.
